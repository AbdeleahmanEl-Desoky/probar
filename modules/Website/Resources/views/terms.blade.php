                <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
                <p>Last updated: April 13, 2025</p>

                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to ProBar ("App", "Service", "Platform"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of our mobile applications and services provided by ProBar ("we", "us", or "our"), which connect clients seeking barber services ("Clients") with professional barbers and barbershops ("Barbers"). Please read these Terms carefully before using the Service.</p>
                <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all Clients, Barbers, visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>
                <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you do not have permission to use the Service.</p>

                <h2>2. The ProBar Platform</h2>
                <p>ProBar is a dual mobile application platform. One app is for Clients to discover, book, and communicate with Barbers, while the other is for Barbers to manage their barbershops, services, schedules, and client communications.</p>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> ProBar acts solely as a neutral technology provider. We are not a barber shop, salon, or employment agency. Barbers are independent professionals or business owners and are not employees or agents of ProBar. We do not guarantee the quality, safety, legality, or delivery of services provided by Barbers, nor are we responsible for the conduct of any Client or Barber. Any disputes must be resolved directly between the involved parties.</p>

                <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
                <p>To use certain features of the Service, you must create an account — either as a Client or a Barber. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration, and to update your information as needed.</p>
                <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use or security breach. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or engage in prohibited behavior.</p>

                <h2>4. Use License & Conduct</h2>
                <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the ProBar apps for their intended purposes.</p>
                <p>You agree not to misuse the platform. Prohibited actions include but are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing false or misleading information</li>
                    <li>Harassment or abusive behavior toward other users</li>
                    <li>Attempting to bypass or avoid ProBar’s policies or systems</li>
                    <li>Violating local, national, or international laws</li>
                    <li>Reverse engineering, scraping, or interfering with app functionality</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Barbers agree to maintain professional conduct, provide accurate service listings, upload truthful content (such as photos and logos), and follow all relevant health and safety regulations.</p>
                <p>Clients agree to be respectful, provide accurate booking information, and adhere to the platform’s policies.</p>

                <h2>5. Bookings and Cancellations</h2>
                <p>Clients can browse available Barbers, view profiles, and schedule appointments through the app. Cancellation policies, rescheduling options, and late arrival terms are set by each Barber and must be reviewed before booking.</p>
                <p>ProBar may offer tools for in-app reminders and cancellation notices, but does not manage or enforce Barber-specific cancellation fees or refund policies.</p>
                <p>Payment features may be handled directly between the Client and the Barber unless explicitly integrated into the platform in the future.</p>

                <h2>6. Content (Profiles, Photos, Reviews)</h2>
                <p>Barbers may upload profile pictures, shop logos, service images, and shop-related information. Clients may leave reviews based on their experiences.</p>
                <p>By uploading content, you grant ProBar a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, display, and distribute your content as part of the Service.</p>
                <p>Prohibited content includes but is not limited to: offensive or hateful language, nudity or explicit material, copyrighted content without permission, false or misleading information, or content that violates laws or harms others.</p>

                <h2>7. Notifications and Messaging</h2>
                <p>Both Clients and Barbers may receive push notifications for booking updates, appointment reminders, and in-app messages. Messaging is intended for service-related communications only. Abuse of the messaging system may result in account suspension.</p>

                <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>All original content and software within the ProBar platform (excluding user content) is the property of ProBar and its licensors. This includes design elements, features, branding, and trademarks.</p>

                <h2>9. Termination</h2>
                <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the Service at any time without prior notice if we believe you have violated these Terms or engaged in conduct that harms the platform or other users.</p>

                <h2>10. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>The Service is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.” We make no guarantees about the availability, reliability, or accuracy of the Service or any services booked through it.</p>
                <p>ProBar is not liable for any loss, damage, injury, or dispute arising from interactions between Clients and Barbers. Use of the platform is at your own risk.</p>

                <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of [Your Country/State]. Any disputes shall be resolved in the appropriate courts of that jurisdiction.</p>

                <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes, and continued use of the Service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

                <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
                <p>If you have any questions about these Terms or the platform, please contact us at: [Your Contact Email]</p>

                <p><strong>Legal Disclaimer:</strong> This document is provided for informational purposes only. You should consult with a qualified legal professional to ensure that your Terms and Conditions comply with applicable laws in your jurisdiction and match your specific business model, especially regarding payment, data use, and liability clauses.</p>
